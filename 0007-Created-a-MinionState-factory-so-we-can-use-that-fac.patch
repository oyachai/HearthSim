Subject: [PATCH 07/16] Created a MinionState factory so we can use that
 factory instead of always making a new MinionState object
The creation of the MinionStateFactory class was that it will be able to create different type of MinionState by just calling 
the factory. Instead of creating an object for each state when it was needed, by using a MinionStateFactory 
it will simplify the object creation by calling the factory and itâ€™s method such as the makeFrozen(), 
which will then return an object of type frozenState.
